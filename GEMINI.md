# Project Overview

This directory contains the "LLM-Enhanced Distributed MCP Servers" project, a suite of specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers designed to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) applications with cloud-neutral context. The project aims to improve the quality of AI-generated outputs by providing relevant documentation, best practices, and workflow automation capabilities across various cloud environments. It utilizes a client-server architecture where MCP clients (such as AI coding assistants and chatbots) connect to MCP servers to access distributed capabilities. The core technology is the open-source Model Context Protocol.

**Note:** While the project is designed to *enhance LLM applications*, direct LLM implementation within this project is planned for a future phase.

# Key Capabilities

Based on the provided code snippets and updated project scope, the project is designed to provide the following capabilities:

- **Document Management & Analysis:** Features for listing, scanning, and analyzing documents, including services for document operations (`document_service`), handling vector documents, and planned integration with LLMs (`get_llm()`, `get_search()`) and search engines (e.g., Elasticsearch).
- **Interactive Rules/Games:** Implements logic for "Lateral Thinking Puzzles" or "Turtle Soup" style games, with `rules()` and `rules_solver()` functions defining mechanics for interactive reasoning and knowledge exploration, often following human-like interaction guidelines.
- **Distributed MCP Servers:** Specialized servers for interacting with various distributed services, with examples for specific cloud providers (e.g., AWS DocumentDB, AWS Cloud Control API, etc.).
    - **Cloud-Neutral Service Integration:** Tools for integrating with generic distributed services.
    - **Cloud-Specific Examples:** Demonstrations for services like Amazon DocumentDB and Cloud Control API.

# Key Technologies

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** An open protocol for integrating LLM applications with external data sources and tools.
- **Cloud-Neutral Design:** Emphasizes architecture and implementation that avoids vendor lock-in.
- **Python:** Implied as the primary development language, with `uv` and `uvx` used for dependency management.
- **Elasticsearch (Planned):** Indicated integration with Elasticsearch for document indexing and search.

# Building and Running

The installation and setup process generally includes:

1. **Installing `uv`:** Obtain from Astral, as the package manager.  
   `uv python install 3.10`
2. **Installing Python:** Using `uv`.
3. **Configuring AWS Credentials:** Ensure access to required AWS services.
4. **Adding the server to your MCP client configuration:**  
   Specific instructions vary by client (Amazon Q Developer CLI, Kiro, Cline, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Claude Code). Detailed configuration examples for various MCP clients (as displayed by `gh repo view`) typically involve creating a JSON configuration file (e.g., `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`, `kiro_mcp_settings.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc.) with server definitions.

Individual server READMEs (located in `src/<server-name>/README.md`) provide additional installation requirements and configuration details.

# Development Conventions

- **Contributing:** Refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on contributing to the project.
- **Adding New MCP Servers:** See `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for guidance on adding new MCP servers to the library.
- **Design Guidelines:** Adherence to `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` is expected when developing new servers.
- **Security:** Information regarding security issue notifications is available in `CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications`.

## Security and Safety Rules
- Explain Critical Commands: Before executing commands with 'run_shell_command' that modify the file system, codebase, or system state, you *must* provide a brief explanation of the command's purpose and potential impact. Prioritize user understanding and safety. You should not ask permission to use the tool; the user will be presented with a confirmation dialogue upon use (you do not need to tell them this).
- Security First: Always apply security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets, API keys, or other sensitive information.

## No-Pypass File Editing Enforcement

- **Agent's Commitment:** I will always execute `pre_edit_backup.sh` on any file I am about to modify using tools like `replace` or `write_file`. This action will be explicitly stated before the modification occurs.
- **User Reminder:** Before I perform any file modification, I will remind the user of the importance of using `pre_edit_backup.sh` for their manual edits, especially for crucial development files. This ensures a consistent "no-pypass" approach to file editing that is critical for error tracking and project history.

## Tool Usage
- Parallelism: Execute multiple independent tool calls in parallel when feasible (i.e., searching the codebase).
